### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python(spyder)to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Statistics Computed:
1 Popular travel times (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
•	most common month
•	most common day of week
•	most common hour of day
2 Popular stations and trip
•	most common start station
•	most common end station
•	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3 Trip duration
•	total travel time
•	average travel time
4 User info
•	counts of each user type
•	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
•	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
The files used are from three major cities in the United States:
Chicago, New York City, and Washington
All three of the data files contain the same core six(6) columns:
•	Start Time
•	End Time
•	Trip Duration (in seconds)
•	Start Station
•	End Station
•	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
•	Gender
•	Birth Year
